        <p>
          Join a lean, senior team shipping large-scale, synchronized virtual concerts and interactive
          worlds. You'll set our Unreal Engine 5 multiplayer architecture, replication strategy, and
          performance budgets so millions can experience “the same show in many rooms.” We move fast,
          own outcomes, and ship to production.

            Lead the UE5 client and dedicated-server stack; establish authoritative server patterns, RPC/replication

          <li>Partner with Live Ops to define perf targets, LODs, and replication budgets per scene.</li>
